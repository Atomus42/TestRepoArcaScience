## Webflow CMS Setup Steps

1. **Create collections in order** (to handle references):
   - Topics (no refs)
   - Platform Modules (no refs)
   - Therapeutic Areas (no refs)
   - Conferences & Events (no refs)
   - Team Members (no refs)
   - Open Positions (no refs)
   - Regulatory Updates (refs → Therapeutic Areas)
   - Resources (refs → Topics, Therapeutic Areas, Team Members)
   - Case Studies (refs → Therapeutic Areas, Platform Modules)

2. **Add sample data** — Populate 2-3 items per collection for design/testing.

3. **Create Collection Pages** — For collections with slug prefixes, create the
   dynamic page template in Webflow Designer using the HTML blueprints as reference.

4. **Create Collection Lists** — On static pages (homepage, hub pages), add
   Collection Lists bound to the appropriate collection with filters.

5. **Set up conditional visibility** — Use Webflow's conditional visibility to
   show/hide elements based on field values (e.g., show PDF button only if
   Download URL is set).

## Field Naming Convention

All CMS field slugs should use kebab-case:
- `client-name` (not `clientName` or `Client Name`)
- `therapeutic-area` (not `TA` or `Therapeutic_Area`)
- `is-featured` (not `isFeatured`)

This ensures clean data binding in Webflow's Designer and consistent embed code references.
