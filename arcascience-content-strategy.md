## A. Tone & Vocabulary Guidelines

### A.1 Tone Definition

**What the ArcaScience voice IS:**

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| Authoritative | Speaks from deep domain expertise in pharmacoepidemiology, regulatory science, and quantitative benefit-risk analysis. Does not ask permission to have a point of view. |
| Precise | Favors specificity over abstraction. Prefers "24 proprietary AI models trained on structured pharmacovigilance data" over "advanced AI technology." |
| Quietly confident | States facts and lets the reader draw conclusions. Does not amplify claims with superlatives. If the platform processes 100+ billion data points, that number speaks for itself. |
| Scientifically grounded | Every claim is traceable to a methodology, a regulatory framework, or a measurable outcome. Uses the language of the audience's own discipline. |
| Respectful of complexity | Acknowledges that benefit-risk assessment involves irreducible trade-offs, heterogeneous patient populations, and evolving regulatory expectations. Never pretends otherwise. |

**What the ArcaScience voice is NOT:**

| Anti-pattern | Why it fails |
|---|---|
| Breathless / hyperbolic | A VP of Drug Safety at a top-20 pharma company has spent 15+ years evaluating safety signals. They will dismiss language that overpromises. |
| Generic SaaS marketing | ArcaScience is not a project management tool. Language like "streamline your workflow" signals that the writer does not understand the domain. |
| Oversimplified | Reducing ICH E1/E2E guidance to "we help with compliance" insults the reader's expertise. The audience knows what these frameworks require; the question is how ArcaScience addresses those requirements specifically. |
| Jargon-heavy without purpose | Using complex terminology to sound impressive, rather than to communicate precisely, is the opposite of scientific communication. Every technical term must earn its place. |
| Salesy / pushy | The decision to adopt a BRA platform involves regulatory, clinical, and organizational considerations. Pressure tactics are inappropriate and counterproductive. |

### A.2 Approved Vocabulary

### A.3 Banned Vocabulary

| Banned Term/Phrase | Why | Acceptable Alternative |
|---|---|---|
| Revolutionize / revolutionary | Hyperbolic; unsubstantiated | "Redefines how [specific process] is conducted" — only if defensible |
| Cutting-edge / bleeding-edge | Generic; meaningless | Describe the specific technical approach |
| Game-changing / game-changer | Cliche; unserious | State the measurable outcome |
| Leverage (as verb) | Corporate jargon | "Use," "apply," "integrate," "draw on" |
| Unlock / unlock insights | Vague; SaaS cliche | "Surface," "identify," "quantify," "detect" |
| Streamline your workflow | Generic SaaS | Describe what specifically becomes faster or more accurate |
| Powerful platform | Empty modifier | Describe what the platform does, specifically |
| Next-generation / next-gen | Overused; undefined | Describe the architecture or methodology |
| Seamless / seamlessly | Almost never accurate | "Integrates with [specific system] via [specific mechanism]" |
| End-to-end (in hero/headline) | Currently overused; retiring from hero position | Use in body copy sparingly; prefer describing the actual start-to-end scope |
| One-stop shop | Trivializing | Describe the breadth of coverage with specifics |
| Turnkey | Implies no effort; unrealistic | "Pre-configured for [specific use case]" |
| Best-in-class | Unsubstantiated superlative | Cite the specific metric that demonstrates superiority |
| World-class | Same | Same |
| Empower / empowering | Vague; patronizing | Describe the specific capability the user gains |
| Disrupt / disruptive | Overused; antagonistic | Describe the specific improvement over status quo |
| Holistic | Vague | "Comprehensive" or describe the specific scope |
| Robust (without qualification) | Filler adjective | Describe what makes it robust: "validated against [X]," "tested across [Y] therapeutic areas" |
| AI-powered (as standalone descriptor) | Insufficient; everyone claims AI | Specify: "24 proprietary models trained on [data type] for [specific task]" |

### A.4 Handling Complexity: Translation Rules

1. **Never simplify the concept; simplify the sentence structure.** A VP of Drug Safety understands what a disproportionality analysis is. They do not need it explained. They need to understand how ArcaScience's approach to disproportionality analysis differs from what they currently do.

2. **Use the audience's own terminology.** If the concept has an established term in pharmacovigilance or regulatory science, use that term. Do not invent synonyms.

3. **When a technical concept must be introduced (e.g., for investors or non-specialist audiences), provide a precise one-sentence definition in parentheses or as a subordinate clause.** Do not create a separate "glossary" tooltip that interrupts reading flow on specialist-facing pages.

4. **Quantify wherever possible.** Instead of "significantly faster," write "60% reduction in evaluation time, measured across 50+ regulatory submissions." The audience respects data, not adjectives.

5. **Acknowledge limitations and trade-offs.** Stating that the platform "supports structured benefit-risk assessment by integrating heterogeneous data sources" is more credible than claiming it "solves benefit-risk." The audience knows that benefit-risk assessment is inherently a judgment-intensive process.

6. **One idea per sentence, one theme per paragraph.** Regulatory science is dense. Clarity comes from structure, not from simplification.

7. **Use active voice and name the actor.** "ArcaScience's Data Intelligence Engine identifies drug-drug interactions at 3x the detection rate of manual literature review" is stronger than "Drug-drug interactions are identified more effectively."

---

## C. Scientific Credibility Rules

### C.1 Citing Regulatory Frameworks

1. **Always use the official designation.** Write "ICH E2C(R2)" not "ICH E2C" (unless specifically referencing the original, non-revised guideline). Write "FDA 21 CFR Part 11" not "CFR Part 11."

2. **When referencing a framework, state what it governs.** Do not assume the reader will connect the dots — not because they lack knowledge, but because precision demonstrates that the writer understands the framework.
   - Correct: "Automated PSUR generation aligned with ICH E2C(R2), which governs the format, content, and periodicity of periodic benefit-risk evaluation reports."
   - Incorrect: "Compliant with ICH guidelines."

3. **Do not claim compliance with frameworks that are guidance, not law.** ICH guidelines are adopted differently across jurisdictions. Write "aligned with" or "consistent with" rather than "compliant with" for ICH guidelines. Reserve "compliant with" for binding regulations (e.g., 21 CFR Part 11, GDPR).

4. **Reference BRAT and MCDA correctly.**
   - BRAT (Benefit-Risk Action Team) framework: Developed by the PROTECT consortium and adopted by FDA's Sentinel Initiative. It is a structured framework for organizing and communicating benefit-risk assessments; it is not a quantitative method on its own.
   - MCDA (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis): A family of quantitative methods. When referencing, specify whether ArcaScience uses weighted scoring, outranking, or other specific MCDA approaches.

5. **CIOMS references must include the Working Group number.**
   - Correct: "Signal detection methodology informed by CIOMS VIII (Practical Aspects of Signal Detection in Pharmacovigilance)."
   - Incorrect: "Based on CIOMS guidelines."

### C.2 Referencing Data Without Overclaiming

1. **State the denominator.** "50+ regulatory submissions" is a claim. It becomes credible when you add context: "50+ regulatory submissions across 12 therapeutic areas for 20+ pharmaceutical companies since 2018."

2. **Distinguish between platform outputs and client outcomes.** The platform produces analyses; the client makes decisions. Write "The platform identified the thromboembolic risk signal that informed Sanofi's decision to re-route development investment" — not "The platform saved Sanofi millions."

3. **Use directional language for comparative claims that lack controlled measurement.** "9x more insights" requires careful handling:
   - Acceptable: "In comparative evaluations, ArcaScience's platform identified an average of 9x more clinically relevant safety and efficacy signals than manual literature review conducted over the same timeframe."
   - Unacceptable: "9x more insights than competitors."
   - The term "insights" should be defined or replaced with "signals," "associations," or "findings" depending on context.

4. **Percentage claims must specify the baseline.** "60% faster" — faster than what? Specify: "60% reduction in evaluation time compared to traditional CRO-led benefit-risk assessments, measured across [N] engagements."

5. **Cost claims must acknowledge scope.** "70% cost reduction vs. CROs" — specify what is included: "70% reduction in total engagement cost for structured benefit-risk assessments compared to equivalent scope delivered by traditional contract research organizations, based on [N] comparative evaluations."

### C.3 Rules for Metrics

| Scenario | Approach |
|---|---|
| Metric is precisely measured and verifiable | State the exact figure with context: "3x improvement in DDI detection rate, measured against manual MedLine review across [N] compound evaluations." |
| Metric is an average or range | State it as such: "Clients report a 50-70% reduction in document production time for PSUR/PBRER generation." |
| Metric is directional but not precisely controlled | Use qualifying language: "In head-to-head evaluations, ArcaScience consistently identified significantly more safety-relevant findings than manual approaches." |
| Metric is a client-reported outcome | Attribute it: "According to [Client/Role], the platform [specific outcome]." |
| Metric involves competitive comparison | Never name competitors. Compare to "traditional approaches," "manual review," or "CRO-led assessments." |

### C.4 Rules for Testimonials and Case Studies

1. **Every testimonial must be attributed.** At minimum: name, title, company. If anonymization is required: title, company type (e.g., "VP of Drug Safety, Top-10 Global Pharmaceutical Company").

2. **Testimonials must describe specific outcomes, not general praise.** "ArcaScience is great" is worthless. "ArcaScience's platform identified a thromboembolic risk signal in our Phase 3 data that had not been flagged by our internal pharmacovigilance team, which informed our decision to re-allocate development resources" is credible.

3. **Case studies must follow a structured format:**
   - **Context:** Therapeutic area, development phase, regulatory jurisdiction, specific challenge
   - **Approach:** What ArcaScience did — which platform capabilities were used, what data sources were integrated
   - **Findings:** What the analysis revealed — specific, quantified where possible
   - **Outcome:** What the client did with the findings — regulatory decision, development decision, labeling outcome
   - **Attribution:** Client name (if permitted) or anonymized descriptor

4. **Never imply regulatory endorsement.** The fact that a submission was accepted does not mean the regulator endorsed ArcaScience's methodology. Write: "The benefit-risk analysis produced by ArcaScience's platform was included in the regulatory submission, which received [approval/positive opinion]." Do not write: "Regulators approved ArcaScience's analysis."

5. **The Sanofi case study** should be referenced as follows (adjust based on permission level):
   - Full attribution: "Sanofi's team used ArcaScience's platform to conduct a benefit-risk assessment that identified a previously undetected thromboembolic risk signal, informing the decision to re-route significant development investment."
   - If quantification is permitted: include the specific financial figure ("millions in development funds")
   - Always clarify that the decision was Sanofi's; ArcaScience provided the analysis.

## Page 4: Decision Intelligence (Analytics/Visualization)

### H1 Headline
**"Benefit-Risk Decision Intelligence Aligned with BRAT and MCDA Frameworks"**

### H2 Sub-headline
**"Quantified trade-offs, scenario modeling, and interactive visualizations — designed for regulatory communication."**

### Hero Paragraph
Decision Intelligence translates the analytical output of ArcaScience's Data Intelligence Engine into structured benefit-risk assessments that regulators, advisory committees, and internal decision-makers can evaluate. The module implements BRAT framework methodology and multi-criteria decision analysis, presenting results through effects tables, value trees, and scenario comparisons. Every analytical choice — weighting, threshold selection, subpopulation definition — is auditable, reproducible, and defensible.

### Section Breakdown

**Section 1: Framework Implementation**
- Title: "BRAT, MCDA, and Quantitative Benefit-Risk Methods — Implemented, Not Just Referenced"
- Key points:
  - BRAT framework: how ArcaScience operationalizes the four BRAT steps (define decision context, identify outcomes, source data, present results)
  - MCDA: specific methods supported (e.g., weighted scoring, SMAA — Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis — if applicable)
